      <h2>About DilSe NGO</h2>
      <p>
        DilSe NGO is a non-profit organization committed to serving humanity with 
        compassion and integrity. Our mission is to improve lives by focusing on three
        core areas—education, healthcare, and livelihood support. We work hand in hand
        with local communities, volunteers, and partners to empower individuals, 
        uplift underprivileged families, and build a society where every person has
        the opportunity to live with dignity. Through sustainable initiatives, 
        awareness programs, and active community engagement, we strive 
        to create lasting impact from the heart—Dil Se.
